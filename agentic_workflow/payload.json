  "general_description": "You were setting up a basic search agent using Google's ADK library. The agent is designed to use a language model to answer questions by utilizing Google Search for grounding the information. The project's files seem consistent across different snapshots with no visible changes between them.",
  "suggested_current_task": "Verify the correctness of the agent's configuration and ensure it behaves as expected by running some tests to confirm that the integration with the Google Search tool is functioning properly. Also, consider adding documentation or comments to improve code maintainability if needed."
